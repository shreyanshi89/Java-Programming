/*
 WAP in Java which would contain 8 objects of a Class Employee. Employee contains name, age, department, salary.
 Your program would be able to calculate the total salary to be paid in each department. Use constructors to create
 these 8 objects and Scanner to take inputs
 
 Restrictions:
	1- Minimum 8 objects [can be created manually with parameterized constructors with Scanner input]
	2- Departments are, A, B, C, D: minimum 4 departments [String Type]
	3- If the Salary exceeds more than 30,000, then the default salary would be 25000 of any of the employee
	4- Use array of objects, instead of using multiple 8 objects separately

 Use: 
	Employee arr[] = new Employee[8];
	And
	arr[i].department.equals("A")
